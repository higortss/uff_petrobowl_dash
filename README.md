## UFF Petrobowl Dashboard

A WebApp to manage games and inform performance from two teams.

#How-to
Just select the team, run the clock and wait for it to run out. If what runs out first is your patience, you can always click "Reset" and restart the clock. Each right question is worth +10 points, each wrong one is worth -05.

Good luck!

## Purpose

We, the Petrobowl Team of Universidade Federal Fluminense had no better way to manage game-time and scores from our participants, so decided it was time to invest a little bit of our time into a tool that could be useful for our day-to-day training, and also help other Petrobowl teams around the world.

## Contributing

Namely @DuckRodgers and @higortss (in alphabetic order).

## Current Phase

This is still Phase 1 of the project. Only a gameclock, score and player's name.

## Planned Improvements

Next phase will be creating the actual game based on the input of a standard file. Another future implementation is an actual dashboard to evaluate how is each player performing.

Call us through GitHub, we are locked somewhere in here and can't seem to get out.

Tell my mom I'm ok.
